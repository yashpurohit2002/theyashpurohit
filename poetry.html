                            Poetry may just be the first thing I've done for myself<br>
                            Seeking no validation but just my own truth<br>
                            Seeking no aspiration, just a collection for my shelf<br>
                            As I continue to live and write throughout my life's youth
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            This isn't me chasing a degree or some materialist gain<br>
                            Nor is this a shot at fame in a crude and complicated way<br>
                            This is just some writing when I have a thing to explain<br>
                            Before I once again fall as the corporate world's prey
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            So please enjoy my journal about desires<br>
                            A deep and vulnerable look into my life<br>
                            Some are harsh, some maybe a tad dryer<br>
                            And some writings are larger-than life
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            But at the end of the day, this is how I journal<br>
                            How I jot my thoughts, emotions, and worries<br>
                            Maybe this is just some way to make me eternal<br>
                            Just before life catches up and hurries
                            </p>
